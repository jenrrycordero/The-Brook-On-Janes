Hi there!


this theme is using sass files
to install compass -> http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-wordpress-development-process-using-sass-and-compass--cms-21861

To compile to css run script from command-line:

cd to config.rb location and run "compass watch"

for example:
cd www/the-brook-theme-main/wp-content/themes/the-brook-theme/theme-assets
compass watch

this script watch all you changes and will compile every time you save changes
